# Background

## EN1: Basic endurance training.
EX: 8X500 with 60”R

Min internal distance 500, Max distance 1000
1 min rest regardless of distance
Target working yardage 4000-6000
pace 5-15 seconds slower than css

One big set, no subsets

## EN2: Threshold endurance training.

Example workout:
18X100 with 10”r at CSS
2-3 mins rest
10X200 with 20”r at CSS
2-3 mins rest
5X400 with 40”r at CSS
2-3 mins rest
3X600 with 60”r at CSS

pace is CSS 

rest follow this pattern up to sets of 1000s. I think anything more than a 600 you would get 90 seconds rest.

Rest follows this pattern
100 is 10 seconds rest
200 is 20 second rest
3008s 30 seconds rest

Sets go for 1500-2500 yards
2-3 mins rest in-between sets

## EN3: Overload endurance training.
Pace is 1” to 2” faster than CSS.
4X500 with 60”r
4X400 with 45”r
4x600 with 90”r

EN3 should have only be intervals between 400-600 yards.

No rest between sets

## SP1: Lactate tolerance training.
3” to 5” faster than CSS.
interval distances between 25 to 200yd with double or triple the rest of EN2. So for 100s - we like to see 20 - 30 seconds of rest.  
for 200s we like to see 40-60 seconds rest.

Sets of 400 to 800yd.
1-2 mins rest in between sets

## SP2: Lactate production training.
Speed: Near max.
Set distances between 25 to 50yd with 1’ to 3’ for 25yds set and 3’ to 5’ for 50yds set.
Set length: 300 to 600yds
Full Rest between sets
